# PCSG

Data, source codes and an example for paper "*[PCSG: Pattern-Coverage Snippet Generation for RDF Datasets]()*". 

> For reusing an RDF dataset, understanding its content is a prerequisite. To support the comprehension of its large and complex structure, existing methods mainly generate an abridged version of an RDF dataset by extracting representative data patterns as a summary. As a complement, recent attempts extract a representative subset of concrete data as a snippet. We extend this line of research by injecting the strength of summary into snippet. We propose to generate a pattern-coverage snippet that best exemplifies the patterns of entity descriptions and links in an RDF dataset. Our approach incorporates formulations of group Steiner tree and set cover problems to generate compact snippets. This extensible approach is also capable of modeling query relevance to be used with dataset search. Experiments on thousands of real RDF datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of our approach. 

## Data

### Datasets and Queries

Datasets, queries and query-dataset pairs used in the experiments are provided in [data](https://github.com/nju-websoft/PCSG/tree/main/data).

1. In [1-evaluation-of-pcsg](https://github.com/nju-websoft/PCSG/tree/main/data/1-evaluation-of-pcsg), the file *dataset.tsv* lists all RDF datasets used in the experiment, the first column is a local ID of each dataset, the second column is the title of the dataset, the third and following (if any) column(s) show the links to the dataset dump files. Note that one dataset can have more than one dump files. 
2. In [2-evaluation-of-qpcsg](https://github.com/nju-websoft/PCSG/tree/main/data/2-evaluation-of-qpcsg), the file *query-dataset-pair.tsv* lists all the query-dataset (or Q-D for short) pairs used in the experiment. The first column is a local ID of each Q-D pair, the second column is the local ID of the dataset (which is the same as in *1-evaluation-of-pcsg*), the third colunm is the keyword query where each keyword was separated by ``" "``. 
3. In [3-comparison-with-summary](https://github.com/nju-websoft/PCSG/tree/main/data/3-comparison-with-summary), the file *pcsg80.ttl* is the result snippet, the file *abstat-summary.tsv* is the result summary of ABSTAT. The SPARQL query patterns used in the experiment are provided in *sparql-queries-for-test.txt*. 

### Real-world Snippet Results

TBD

## Source Codes and Dependencies

All source codes of implementation are provided in [code/src](https://github.com/nju-websoft/PCSG/tree/main/code/src). 

### Dependencies

- JDK 8+
- MySQL 5.6+
- Apache Lucene 7.5.0
- JGraphT 1.3.0

useful packages (jar files) are provided in [code/lib](https://github.com/nju-websoft/PCSG/tree/main/code/lib). 

### Run an Example

We provide an example dataset to run our algorithm PCSG, here are the steps: 

1. Move [code/example](https://github.com/nju-websoft/PCSG/tree/main/code/example) to your local folder, in which *dataset.txt* contains the triple of element IDs. Each ID is corresponding to the number of row in *label.txt* , where the first column shows if this element is a literal, and the second column shows the textual form of the element. 
2. Open *DatasetIndexer.java* in *src/PCSG/example/*, edit the variable "*folder*" to your local folder path. 
3. Run all the steps in *DatasetIndex.main()*, to generate index for EDPs, LPs, get set cover components for the dataset, and get the hub labels for the Group Steiner Tree. 
4. Edit the folder path in *getResultTree.java* and run, the edges of the result Group Steiner Trees will be output to terminal. 
5. IlluSnip for the example can be similarly generated by running after editing the folder path in *illusnipTest.java*.
