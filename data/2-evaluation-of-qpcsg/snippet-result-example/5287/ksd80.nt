The evidence-based findings (based on interviews, focus groups, & behavior mapping) are expected to support future design of public parks in the District and beyond. \n\nOur expected outcome is building capacity within the community, better understanding of how to program parks for community, suggestions for future improvements, and a report that can be shared with the community, other neighborhoods, and Seattle Parks & Recreation. This project will be completed by January 31, 2019." .
