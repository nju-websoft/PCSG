The event will celebrate what they love about the places they live through creative expression and performances by local artists as well as provide a safe space to focus existing passions into creative actions.  \n\n\n\nYouth and adult facilitated workshops will inform participants about Food Justice, Violence Prevention, Systems of Power and Oppression, and Navigating College/Job Application Process." .

This intersection contains a highly confusing five way pedestrian, and bicycle interchange that is unsafe in its current condition. This unique interchange is a great location to create a sense of place and bring together diverse community partners around a common urban design improvement project.  This project will be completed by June 2018." .
