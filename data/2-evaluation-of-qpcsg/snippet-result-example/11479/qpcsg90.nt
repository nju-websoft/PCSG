The event will celebrate what they love about the places they live through creative expression and performances by local artists as well as provide a safe space to focus existing passions into creative actions.  \n\n\n\nYouth and adult facilitated workshops will inform participants about Food Justice, Violence Prevention, Systems of Power and Oppression, and Navigating College/Job Application Process." .
