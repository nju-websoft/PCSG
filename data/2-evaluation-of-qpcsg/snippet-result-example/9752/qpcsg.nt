Participants will be given opportunities to take action towards these changes and voice their ideas to Mayor Mike McGinn.  The event will celebrate what they love about the places they live through creative expression and performances by local artists as well as provide a safe space to focus existing passions into creative actions.  \n\n\n\nYouth and adult facilitated workshops will inform participants about Food Justice, Violence Prevention, Systems of Power and Oppression, and Navigating College/Job Application Process." .

This intersection contains a highly confusing five way pedestrian, and bicycle interchange that is unsafe in its current condition. This unique interchange is a great location to create a sense of place and bring together diverse community partners around a common urban design improvement project.  This project will be completed by June 2018." .
