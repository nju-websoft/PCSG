The first day, March 21st, will feature a free public lecture provided by Robert Glennon, law professor and author of \\\"America's Water Crisis and What to Do About It.\\\"  This event will also feature Congressman Jay Inslee and a special video message from famed water activist Alexandra Cousteau.
