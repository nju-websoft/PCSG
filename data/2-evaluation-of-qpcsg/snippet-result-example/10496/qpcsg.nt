Participants will be given opportunities to take action towards these changes and voice their ideas to Mayor Mike McGinn.  The event will celebrate what they love about the places they live through creative expression and performances by local artists as well as provide a safe space to focus existing passions into creative actions.  \n\n\n\nYouth and adult facilitated workshops will inform participants about Food Justice, Violence Prevention, Systems of Power and Oppression, and Navigating College/Job Application Process." .

Both the City of Seattle and King County proclaimed Willie Austin Day on April 27, 2013. This year 'Willie Austin Day' will be a celebration of Willie Austin's life and a day for families to come together for a fun day of fitness activities, a healthy hot meal, and engage with community organizations that provide resources in a mini health fair. The event will have a DJ and MC playing fun family friendly music to get everyone moving and commit to their health and fitness goals. The Austin Foundation's mission is to make fitness accessible to the under served and economically disadvantaged communities." .
