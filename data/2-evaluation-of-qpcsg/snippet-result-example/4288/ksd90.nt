The STB program was developed by the American College of Surgeons to train people with little or no medical education in effective methods of preventing death from hemorrhage. These methods, the application of tourniquets, wound packing and pressure, have been proven and tested by the military in Afghanistan and Iraq. The program is very similar to the citizen CPR program.  It is a free 2-hour class that includes a video, lecture, time for questions, and hands-on practice. The skills learned are applicable for mass casualty incidents such as bombings, shootings, earthquakes, traffic or train accidents and as well as individual traumas.  This project will be completed by September 28, 2018." .
