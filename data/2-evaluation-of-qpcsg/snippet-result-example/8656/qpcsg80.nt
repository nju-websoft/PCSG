Many properties are not frequently visited.  The notices are often reminders that the herbicide application was completed and that their dollars were in fact put to use." .

With my board I have been through the process of  our lake study and IVAMP  as required by government agencies(DOE and others) several years ago to allow us to be permitted for treatment of vegetation.\nThere are proposals for changes to the permit  that concern me:\nOne is S5E1e Shoreline Posting Requirements\nOur lake is only 12 acres(really a pond by State definition) and a requirement to leave the postings up and have the contractor return to take them down would be another expense to us---and most of us, including myself, take the postings down after the required amount of time listed on the poster.  Trust the citizens, we can handle this. There is no public access and we do leave the posting up at the community area for a longer period of time.\n \nTwo is G2 Right of Entry and Inspection\nNo one should be entering private property without permission of the owner without a warrant with specification of reason(unless of course law enforcement sees a crime being committed)  Our HOA can grant permission to DOE reps and allow them to enter the lake at our community property if there is a need.  There may be a constitutional question here." .

I own lake front property on Lake Debra Jane. I live at 18716 McGhee Dr E Bonney Lake WA 98391 my phone is 425.765.7459.\n\nI completely disagree with the responses forwarded to me to concur. As a licensed PE in the State of Washington I support NPDES requirements for the hired contractor to remove the notices upon a the notification postings. The non response of this in the past leaves the safety of the public at risk and prohibits knowledge of the restrictions.\n\nI also know you need the addresses of the affected. I agree the contractor hired shall submit those to ecology.\n\nRight of entry is granted to my property at all times to inspect as part of the permit requirements with a notice ahead for entry as required by law, the blanket right of entry does not follow the RCWs and requires advanced notice to the property owner to inspect and the proper legal agreements on record. This requirement I agree with those conditions since the contractor should have a QA QC check on issues. \n\nI have seen several non compliance issues with this contractor and posted complaints. I understand and implement NPDES permit requirements for my living and am aware of all the non compliance issues and complaints for this contractor as well as the fines and penalties and believe that the HOA should get bids on a qualified contractor not bending the rules. \n________________________________________\nFrom: WILLIAM C FAULK \nSent: Saturday, December 12, 2015 12:20 PM\nTo: amkdavidson@gmail.com; Chris Mayfield; Dan Beebe; Gary Leaf; Jeff Brain; Kelly McClimans; Mark Snell; Marny Weber; maryanne zukowski; Melissa Gubbe; Todd Offner; Wendy Schwartznau\nSubject: 2016 NPDESaft Permit \n \nSince we only have until Dec.l8 to give our feedback on this new permit I am forwarding it to the homeowners who have lakefront property that I have e-mail addresses for.

I have reviewed your agencyâ€™s draft NPDES permit and have a few comments related to this draft permit.\nPage 26 -S5E1e Shoreline Posting Requirements\ne. Remove all old signs at the end of the period of water use restriction.\nThis requirement will serve no purpose. I have noticed that most of the signage lake-wide  is removed by the property owners shortly after treatment  Requiring the contractor to come back to the lake after all of the restrictions have expired to remove the few remaining  signs will only add additional costs to our treatment program. All of the water use restrictions are identified on the postings. Once my family is aware of the restrictions I typically remove them anyway. \nPage 27 S5 C6  Notification\n6. The Permittee must email to Ecology, at apampreposttreat@ecy.wa.gov, a copy of the notice, the date of distribution, and a list of addresses that the notice was delivered to, no later than one business day following public distribution. The Permittee must email a copy of the notice, including the date of distribution, to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR at Todd.Brownlee@dnr.wa.gov no later than one business day following public distribution. The Permittee need not notify DNR for treatments occurring on privately-owned lakes with no public access.\nI find this to be an intrusion of my personal space.  By demanding the Permittee submit this list to your agency, you are allowing this information to be available to any person or environmental group, locally and nationally, for their own agenda, through the Freedom of Information Act.  Other means would appear to be appropriate for Ecology to determine if such notifications have been made. Perhaps such personal information should only be submitted after a complaint of not receiving such notice has been documented to be true.   \nPage 39 G2 Right of Entry and Inspection\nRepresentatives of Ecology must have the right to enter at all reasonable times in or upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of inspecting and investigating conditions relating to the pollution or the possible pollution of any waters of the state.\nI am against Ecology entering my property without first contacting me and receiving permission. Ecology already has such access through public boat launches. Since the treatment  activity typically takes place in the water and not on my property I am not in favor of allowing any access without first contacting me for approval." .
