Be about it.\\\"  These make clear our mission of empowering youth to take action in their communities and be the change they want to see.  We intend to bring together 150-200 youth ages 13-19 living in the Southwest Seattle area for the purpose of discussing the issues that face their community and act on concrete changes they want to see in their neighborhood.  Participants will be given opportunities to take action towards these changes and voice their ideas to Mayor Mike McGinn.  The event will celebrate what they love about the places they live through creative expression and performances by local artists as well as provide a safe space to focus existing passions into creative actions.  \n\n\n\nYouth and adult facilitated workshops will inform participants about Food Justice, Violence Prevention, Systems of Power and Oppression, and Navigating College/Job Application Process." .
