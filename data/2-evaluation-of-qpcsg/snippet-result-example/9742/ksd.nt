It is in a high foot and vehicle traffic area, full of weeds, and a magnet for litter.  This spring, the Willow Street Neighbors will till the soil and remove invasive species (grass, English ivy, shopping carts).  The soil will be amended with compost and hardy, drought-tolerant plant species and a new tree will be added.  Plants will be chosen for both their beauty and their low-maintenance.  This beautification effort will foster a renewed sense of community, ownership and responsibility." .
